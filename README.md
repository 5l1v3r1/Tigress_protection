# Tigress Protections

> [Tigress](http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/) is a diversifying virtualizer/obfuscator for the C language that supports many novel defenses against both static and dynamic reverse engineering and de-virtualization attacks.
> In particular, Tigress protects against static de-virtualization by generating virtual instruction sets of arbitrary complexity and diversity, by producing interpreters with multiple types of instruction dispatch, and by inserting code for anti alias analysis. Tigress protects against dynamic de-virtualization by merging the real code with bogus functions, by inserting implicit flow, and by creating slowly-executing reenetrant interpreters. Tigress implements its own version of code packing through the use of runtime code generation. Finally, Tigress' dynamic transformation provides a generalized form of continous runtime code modification.

# Tigress Challenge

Tigress team has provided some [challenges](http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/challenges.html#current) where we can find different kind of protections

* **VM-0**: One level of virtualization, random dispatch.
* **VM-1**: One level of virtualization, superoperators, split instruction handlers.
* **VM-2**: One level of virtualization, bogus functions, implicit flow.
* **VM-3**: One level of virtualization, instruction handlers obfuscated with arithmetic encoding, virtualized function is split and the split parts merged.
* **VM-4**: Two levels of virtualization, implicit flow.
* **VM-5**: One level of virtualization, one level of jitting, implicit flow.
* **VM-6**: Two levels of jitting, implicit flow.

# Challenge Format

All challenges take as input a number and return a hash. Example:

<pre>
$ ./obfuscated_binaries/tigress-2-challenge-2 1234
202180712448

$ ./obfuscated_binaries/tigress-2-challenge-2 823748
50564355584

$ ./obfuscated_binaries/tigress-2-challenge-2 2834723
50714072576
</pre>

The hash computation function is obfuscated. Types of possible attacks:

* In a source recovery attack the task is to identify the algorithm that computes SECRET.
* In a data recovery attack the task is to extract a specific run-time or compile-time data item.
* In a metadata recovery attack the task is to identify the sequence of transformations that resulted in SECRET, along with arguments to those transformations, such as the dispatch method used in a virtualization.
* In a location attack the task is to identify the code bytes of the program that comprise the obfuscated SECRET function.

# Automatic deobfuscation

Our goals were to:

* Symbolically extract the hash algorithm
* Simplify these symbolic expressions
* Provide a new simplified version of the binary

And all of this with only one generic script :). To do so, we made in the following order:

* Parse protected binaries with [LIEF](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF/)
* Symbolically emulate the obfuscated binary with [Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton)
* Concretize everything which are not related to the user input.
* Convert Triton's expressions to the [Arybo's](https://github.com/quarkslab/arybo) expressions
* Convert Arybo's expressions to the LLVM-IR representation
* Apply LLVM optimizations (O2)
* Rebuild a simplified binary version

If you want more information, you can checkout our [solve-vm.py](solve-vm.py) script.

# solve-vm.py

However, we already pushed all of our results in this repository but if you want to reproduce by yourself this
analysis, you only have to do execute `solve-vm.py` like this:

<pre>
$ ./solve-vm.py ./obfuscated_binaries/_binary_
</pre>

Example:

<pre>

</pre>

Then, symbolic expressions can be found [here](symbolic_expressions), LLVM representations can be found [here](llvm_expressions)
and recompiled binaries can be found [here](deobfuscated_binaries).

Using Docker:

<pre>
$ git clone git@github.com:JonathanSalwan/Tigress_protection.git
$ cd /path/to/Tigress_protection
$ docker build -t image_tigress_protection . 
$ docker run -v /path/to/Tigress_protection:/root/Tigress_protection -ti --name=tigress_protection --ulimit='stack=-1:-1' image_tigress_protection
</pre>

Test inside Docker container
<pre>
# cd ~/Tigress_protection
# ./solve-vm.py tigress-challenges/tigress-0-challenge-0
</pre>

# Testing our simplified binaries

As we simplified and recompiled new binaries, we must provide the same behavior of the original binaries. So, to test our binary versions we use this [script](scripts/testing_equality.py).

<pre>
$ ./scripts/testing_equality.py ./tigress-challenges/tigress-0-challenge-0 ./deobfuscated_binaries/tigress-0-challenge-0.deobfuscated

Basically, this script runs the obfuscated and the deobfuscated binaries with random inputs and checks if they have the same output results.

# Regarding the Tigress challenge, what are results?

![Tigress results](misc/tigress_challenges.png)

Concerning the table of ratios, after solved Tigress challenges we asked to Christian Collberg the sources of its
challenges in order to compare the size the original sources and our devirtualized versions. Note that at the request
of Christian, we cannot provide sources of the Tigress challenges, if you want these sources please directly ask
to him :).

# Testing our approach on others binaries

We also pick up 20 hash algorithms (10 well-known, 10 from the Tigress challenge) and we protected each one of these algorithms
using 46 different Tigress protections (see next section). At the end, we have a test bench of 920 protected binaries. Each one of these protected
binaries has been successfully devirtualized using the `solve-vm.py` script. These hash algorithms can be found in the [samples](samples)
directory and their devirtualized versions into the [deobfuscated_binaries](deobfuscated_binaries) directory. The following table is a summary of
our results regarding our 920 samples.
